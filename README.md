# WeatherStation-ObserverDesignPattern
Consider there is a weather station. This weather 
station updates different weather attributes like 
humidity, temperature, pressure etc. There are 
different displays - com.demo.weatherStationWithoutObserverDesignPattern.StatisticsDisplay, 
com.demo.weatherStationWithoutObserverDesignPattern.ForecastDisplay, com.demo.weatherStationWithoutObserverDesignPattern.CurrentConditionsDisplay that 
shows/ displays their things realtime on the basis
of current humidity, temp, pressure. Please write a program for the same.
